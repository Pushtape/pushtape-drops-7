CHANGELOG for Diff 7.x-2.0+13-dev to 7.x-3.x
============================================

1) System variable names have been changed
------------------------------------------

  Diff system variables were prefixed with "diff_" and node type specific
  variables were tagged with the entity type 'node'

  The full list of variable name changes include:
    - enable_revisions_page_TYPE to  diff_enable_revisions_page_node_TYPE
    - show_diff_inline_TYPE      to  diff_show_diff_inline_node_TYPE
    - show_preview_changes_TYPE  to  diff_show_preview_changes_node_TYPE

  The corresponding changes would be used like:

<?php
-    variable_get('enable_revisions_page_' . $node_type, 1);
+    variable_get('diff_enable_revisions_page_node_' . $node_type, 1);
?>

2) hook_diff() was removed
--------------------------

This has been replaced by hook_entity_diff() as of Diff 7.x-3.x.

3) Field diffs are handled independently by Diff and the field module
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Field modules SHOULD NOT implement hook_entity_diff().

This is complicated and costly in terms of performance.

Two new field callbacks are defined to handle these.

  a) MODULE_field_diff_view_prepare()

  Optional: If you need to load data, use MODULE_field_diff_view_prepare().

  b) MODULE_field_diff_view()

  Recommended: You should implement this to generate the compared data.

If there is no corresponding hook for a field, the field comparison will try
to guess the value using $item['safe_value'] or $item['value'] properties.

If you need to make this configurable, there are two additional hooks:

  c) MODULE_field_diff_default_options($field_type)
  
  You should define any additioal settings here. This shares a global namespace
  of the diff module, so you can overwrite core Diff settings here too.
  
  In saying that, take care not to accidentially do this.
  
  d) MODULE_field_diff_options_form($field_type, $settings)
  
  This is where you insert Form API elements to configure your option settings.

4) Field diffs are now configurable
-----------------------------------

Each field type defined by core (with exception of number module) have
configurable settings to control the rendering of the comparison.

  a) Global configuration

  An administration page has been added to handle field type default settings.
  
  This is the preferred way to configure field settings are these are global to
  all fields of this type.

  b) View mode display options

  Requires the Field formatter settings (field_formatter_settings) module to
  do anything other than toggle the field visibility and weight.

  This allows for fine grain control per content type and per bundle.

  For the Standard comparison, used when comparing different revisions, you
  need to do the following: Basic page (page) is used in these examples.

  - Check "Use Diff standard view mode when doing standard field comparisons"

    Navigate to admin/structure/types/manage/page and look at the Diff settings.

  - Enable "Diff standard" custom view mode

    Navigate to admin/structure/types/manage/page/display and look at the
    Custom Display Settings for this view mode. Check and save.

  - Configure the display

    After Saving this page, a new tab appears "Diff standard", click this or
    navigate directly to admin/structure/types/manage/page/display/diff_standard

    - Options without Field formatter settings module
      These are limited. You can hide or show the fields that you want to
      display when doing comparisons.

    - Options with Field formatter settings module
      All of the global variables mentioned above can be edited per field. Click
      the small clog wheel beside the fields saying "Diff custom settings: No".

      Check "Enable custom Diff settings" and configure the options that you
      want to enable / configure. Click Update, and **Important** Save the page
      using the buttons at the bottom.

5) Standard comparison preview / Inline diff view setting
---------------------------------------------------------

You can set the view modes used to compare the rendered node. This can be found
in the Diff settings in the Content Type settings page.

6) Optional CSS and new Boxes styles
------------------------------------

This takes the styles from WikiPedia to really spice up the diff page.

7) Optional JScript extras
--------------------------

This spices up the revision checkboxes on the revisions page.

8) Simple past revision token support
-------------------------------------

Use-case, email notifications when content has changes. If these support tokens,
then you can embed Diffs into these emails.

9) And much more...
-------------------
